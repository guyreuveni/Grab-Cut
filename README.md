# Grab-Cut
An implementation of the GrabCut algorithm - an algorithm for extracting an object from the background.
GrabCut is an iterative image segmentation algorithm that aims to separate foreground object and background in an image. It starts by user selecting an initial bounding box around the object of interest. Then, it iteratively refines the segmentation by modeling the color distribution of foreground and background pixels using  Gaussians mixture model, optimizing a graph-cut energy function that incorporates both color and spatial information, resulting in an accurate segmentation mask.
